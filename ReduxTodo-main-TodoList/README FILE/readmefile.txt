# Todo List App with User Authentication (Using Local Storage)

This README explains the authentication flow and additional security measures implemented in the Todo List web application with user authentication using React and local storage.

=] Authentication Flow

O:- User Registration (Signup)
1. Users can register for an account by providing a unique username and a secure password.
2. When a user submits the registration form, the application checks if the username is already taken.
3. If the username is unique, the user's credentials (username and hashed password) are stored in local storage, simulating user account creation.

O:- User Login
1. Registered users can log in using their username and password.
2. Upon login, the application verifies the entered credentials by comparing the hashed password stored in local storage with the one entered.
3. If the credentials match, the user is authenticated and can access their tasks.

O:- Authentication State
1. User authentication state is managed using React state.
2. When a user successfully logs in, a session token or a user identifier can be stored in React state to track the user's authentication status.

O:- Protected Routes
1. Certain parts of the application, such as the todo list, are protected routes that can only be accessed by authenticated users.
2. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page if they try to access protected routes.

O:- Task Management
1. Users can create, edit, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
2. Tasks are associated with the logged-in user, ensuring that each user can only see and manage their own tasks.
3. Task data is stored in local storage, preventing data loss on page refresh.

O:- Logout
1. A logout button is provided to allow users to log out of their accounts.
2. When a user logs out, their authentication state is reset, and they are redirected to the login page.

O:- User Interface
1. The application features an intuitive and clean user interface for both the authentication and todo list sections.
2. The todo list displays tasks with options to edit, mark as completed, and delete.

O:- Error Handling
1. User-friendly error messages are displayed for scenarios such as incorrect login credentials, registration errors (e.g., username already taken), or failed task updates.
2. These error messages help users understand and recover from issues encountered during registration, login, or task management.

=] Additional Security Measures

O:- Password Hashing
1. Passwords are securely hashed before storing them in local storage.
2. Hashing adds a layer of security by ensuring that plaintext passwords are not stored, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access sensitive information.

O:- User-Specific Data
1. User-specific data, such as tasks, is stored in a way that associates each piece of data with the user who created it.
2. This ensures that users can only access and manage their own tasks, maintaining data privacy and security.

O:- Secure Communication
1. While local storage is used for data storage, all communications between the client-side application and the server should be done securely using HTTPS.
2. Secure communication helps protect data in transit from interception and tampering.

O:- Session Management
1. Implement session timeouts to automatically log users out after a period of inactivity to enhance security.
2. Clear sensitive session data upon logout to prevent unauthorized access to the application.

O:- Rate Limiting and Input Validation
1. Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on the login and registration forms.
2. Validate user inputs to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

=] Conclusion

This Todo List web application with user authentication and local storage ensures the security of user data, user-specific task management, and an intuitive user experience while following best practices for web application security.
